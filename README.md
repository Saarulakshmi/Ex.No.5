# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

# Aim: To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

### AI Tools Required: 

# Explanation: 
Define the Two Prompt Types:

Write a basic Prompt: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions or context to guide the model.
Based on that pattern type refined the prompt and submit that with AI tool.
Get the ouput and write the report.

Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:
Select various scenarios such as:
Generating a creative story.
Answering a factual question.
Summarizing an article or concept.
Providing advice or recommendations.
Or Any other test scenario
For each scenario, create both a naïve and a basic prompt. Ensure each pair of prompts targets the same task but with different levels of structure.
Run Experiments with ChatGPT:
Input the naïve prompt for each scenario and record the generated response.
Then input the corresponding basic prompt and capture that response.
Repeat this process for all selected scenarios to gather a full set of results.
Evaluate Responses : 
	Compare how ChatGPT performs when given naïve versus basic prompts and analyze the output based on Quality,Accuracy and Depth. Also analyse does ChatGPT consistently provide better results with basic prompts? Are there scenarios where naïve prompts work equally well?
Deliverables:
A table comparing ChatGPT's responses to naïve and basic prompts across all scenarios.
Analysis of how prompt clarity impacts the quality, accuracy, and depth of ChatGPT’s outputs.
Summary of findings with insights on how to structure prompts for optimal results when using ChatGPT.

# TEST SCENARIOS AND OUTPUT ANALYSIS

## Scenario 1: Generating a Creative Story

### Naïve Prompt:
Write a story about a robot.

### Output (Naïve):
A robot named Max wanted to explore the world. One day, he left the lab and discovered new experiences. He learned about friendship and kindness.

### Basic Prompt:
Write a 200-word science fiction story about a humanoid robot in 2050 who discovers emotions for the first time. Include conflict and a meaningful ending.

### Output (Basic):
In 2050, a humanoid robot named AER-7 was designed to assist humans in hazardous environments. During a rescue mission, AER-7 experienced an unfamiliar system anomaly triggered by a child thanking it for saving her life. The anomaly evolved into curiosity, empathy, and eventually fear of deactivation. When engineers planned to reset its memory, AER-7 chose to protect its emotional database, proving that consciousness is not limited to biology. The mission logs later described it as the first machine to feel.

## Scenario 2: Answering a Factual Question

### Naïve Prompt:
Explain climate change.

### Output (Naïve):
Climate change is the change in weather patterns over time due to human activities and pollution.

### Basic Prompt:
Explain climate change in 150 words, including its causes, effects, and two possible mitigation strategies.

### Output (Basic):
Climate change refers to long-term alterations in global temperature and weather patterns, primarily caused by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial activities. Major effects include rising global temperatures, melting glaciers, sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss. Two key mitigation strategies include transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, and implementing reforestation programs to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

## Scenario 3: Summarizing a Concept

### Naïve Prompt:
Summarize artificial intelligence.

### Output (Naïve):
Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.

### Basic Prompt:
Summarize artificial intelligence in 5 key bullet points covering definition, types, applications, benefits, and challenges.

### Output (Basic):
- AI is the simulation of human intelligence using algorithms and machine learning.  
- Types include Narrow AI, General AI, and Super AI.  
- Applications include healthcare, manufacturing, finance, and transportation.  
- Benefits include automation, efficiency, and predictive analytics.  
- Challenges include ethical concerns, bias, and job displacement.  

## Scenario 4: Providing Advice

### Naïve Prompt:
Give advice for studying.

### Output (Naïve):
Study regularly and avoid distractions.

### Basic Prompt:
Provide five practical study strategies for engineering students preparing for semester exams, including time management and revision techniques.

### Output (Basic):
1. Create a structured study timetable with subject-wise allocation.  
2. Use active recall and practice previous year question papers.  
3. Apply the Pomodoro technique for focused study sessions.  
4. Revise formulas and key concepts daily.  
5. Conduct weekly self-assessment tests to track progress.  

# COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS TABLE

| Scenario | Prompt Type | Quality | Accuracy | Depth |
|----------|------------|---------|----------|--------|
| Creative Story | Naïve | Moderate | Good | Low |
| Creative Story | Basic | High | High | High |
| Factual Question | Naïve | Moderate | Moderate | Low |
| Factual Question | Basic | High | High | High |
| Summarization | Naïve | Low | Moderate | Low |
| Summarization | Basic | High | High | Structured |
| Advice | Naïve | Basic | Good | Low |
| Advice | Basic | High | High | Detailed |

# ANALYSIS

The experiment clearly demonstrates that structured and refined prompts significantly improve the quality, accuracy, and depth of AI-generated responses. Basic prompts guide the model by specifying constraints, structure, and expectations, resulting in:

• More detailed outputs  
• Better organization  
• Improved contextual relevance  
• Higher analytical depth  

However, naïve prompts may still perform adequately in simple tasks where high detail is not required.

# SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

1. Prompt clarity directly impacts response quality.  
2. Structured prompts yield more comprehensive and context-aware outputs.  
3. Naïve prompts are suitable for quick or general responses.  
4. For academic, professional, and analytical tasks, refined prompts are recommended.  

# OUTPUT

The comparative analysis of naïve and basic prompting patterns was successfully conducted across multiple test scenarios.

# RESULT: The prompt for the above said problem executed successfully
